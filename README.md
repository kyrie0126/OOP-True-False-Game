# OOP-true-false-game
Practice creating classes for OOP.
This project corresponds to Day 17 of 100 Days of Python on Udemy.
I practiced creating classes with attributes and methods to quickly create a true-false trivia game.
Data is pulled from the Open Trivia Database api - https://opentdb.com/api_config.php.
You can generate your own true-false quizes - just use the api to generate your own data and paste the json data into the data.py file!
